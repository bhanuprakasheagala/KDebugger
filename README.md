a Linux debugger (and eventually a profiler) built with C++

This was something I have wanted to do for a while and all the better
with my love for C++. This project will and currently uses C++17 however
I'm looking too (after completion) to incorperate newer C++20 and 23 features
like coroutines etc... that may help utilize a more modern, asynchronous
architecture.

This project features a debugger tool that I personally use on my Linux
Fedora build for development. Following this I'll make my own dissasembler
and other tools and eventually - fork them into a stuite of tools

# Why
I've always wanted to built a debugger and the tools surrounding it.
This along with my eventual, dissassembler and profiler will hopefully
make its way into a suite of tools I can use personally.

Really, this is just about getting better with C++ - I aim to improve 
and learn new things everyday and granted, this is definitely the project
for such a task. At the moment, It will remain in C++17, when I find time
to convert functions and make them asynchronously and add coroutines, mabye
some concepts and meta-template programming - these will be in the separate 
given branches for people to see how these conversions work
